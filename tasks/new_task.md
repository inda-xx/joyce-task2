### üéÆ Assignment: Develop Your Own Game

You will build a simple game consisting of a player and enemies, in which the player can move, interact with enemies, and maintain a score.

#### Exercise 1.0 -- Design the Player Class
In the `src` folder, create a new class called `Player.java`. This class will have the following fields:

- `String` playerName
- `int` score
- `int[]` position (representing x and y coordinates)
- `boolean` isAlive

In this class, write a `main` method to create a `Player` object, initialize its fields, and print them to the console. Use Example 1 for reference.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Example 1 </summary>

  ```java
  class Player {

    String playerName;
    int score;
    int[] position;
    boolean isAlive;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Player p1 = new Player();

      p1.playerName = "Hero";
      p1.score = 0;
      p1.position = new int[]{0, 0}; // starting at origin
      p1.isAlive = true;

      System.out.println("Player Name: " + p1.playerName);
      System.out.println("Score: " + p1.score);
      System.out.println("Position: " + "(" + p1.position[0] + ", " + p1.position[1] + ")");
      System.out.println("Is Alive: " + p1.isAlive);
    }

  }
  ```
</details>

#### Exercise 1.1 -- Implement Getters and Setters
To encapsulate the fields in your `Player` class, set them to `private` and create their respective getters and setters.

If successful, the adjustments will allow the sample main method in Example 2 to compile.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Example 2 </summary>

  ```java
  class Player {

    private String playerName;
    private int score;
    private int[] position;
    private boolean isAlive;

    public String getPlayerName() {
      return playerName;
    }

    public void setPlayerName(String playerName) {
      this.playerName = playerName;
    }

    public int getScore() {
      return score;
    }

    public void setScore(int score) {
      this.score = score;
    }

    public int[] getPosition() {
      return position;
    }

    public void setPosition(int[] position) {
      this.position = position;
    }

    public boolean isAlive() {
      return isAlive;
    }

    public void setAlive(boolean isAlive) {
      this.isAlive = isAlive;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Player p1 = new Player();

      p1.setPlayerName("Hero");
      p1.setScore(0);
      p1.setPosition(new int[]{0, 0});
      p1.setAlive(true);

      System.out.println("Player Name: " + p1.getPlayerName());
      System.out.println("Score: " + p1.getScore());
      System.out.println("Position: " + "(" + p1.getPosition()[0] + ", " + p1.getPosition()[1] + ")");
      System.out.println("Is Alive: " + p1.isAlive());
    }

  }
  ```
</details>

#### Exercise 1.2 -- Player Constructor
Implement a constructor in the `Player` class that initializes the player's name and position upon creation. Then update the `main` method provided in Example 2 to use your new constructor.

#### Exercise 1.3 -- Move Method
Develop a `move` method that changes the player's position on the board. It should accept `x` and `y` as arguments to update the player's current position.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Example 3 </summary>

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Player hero = new Player("Hero", new int[]{0, 0});
    hero.move(5, 3);
    System.out.println("New Position: " + "(" + hero.getPosition()[0] + ", " + hero.getPosition()[1] + ")");
  }
  ```

  Expected output:
  ```
  > New Position: (5, 3)
  ```
</details>

#### Exercise 1.4 -- Implement Enemy Class
Create an `Enemy.java` class with these fields:

- `String` enemyName
- `int` damage
- `int[]` position

Generate getters and setters for these fields, and construct the class using a suitable constructor.

#### Exercise 1.5 -- Enemy Interaction
Add an `interactWithEnemy` method in the `Player` class. This will take an `Enemy` object as an argument. If the player's position matches an enemy's position, the player loses a life. Update the player's score based on this interaction.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Example 4 </summary>

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Player hero = new Player("Hero", new int[]{0, 0});
    Enemy villain = new Enemy("Villain", 10, new int[]{0, 0});

    hero.interactWithEnemy(villain);
    System.out.println("Player Lives: " + hero.isAlive());
  }
  ```

  Expected output:
  ```
  > Player Lives: false
  ```
</details>

#### Exercise 1.6 -- Scope and Variable Shadowing
Understand the concept by fixing potential issues in Example 5 below where variable names overlap, causing scope confusion.

```Java
class ScopeExample {
    private int value = 10;

    public void show() {
        int value = 20;
        System.out.println(value); // outputs the wrong value
        System.out.println(this.value); // use 'this' to access the correct field
    }
}
```

### üéÆ Assignment - Simple Adventure Game

You're tasked with creating an adventure game where the player navigates a world, earns points, and fends off enemies. Let's design a basic version to get you started:

#### Exercise 1: Class Construction
First, set up basic structures in the `src` folder by creating classes for the `Player`, `Enemy`, and `Game`.

##### Player Class

- Attributes: `String name`, `int score`, `int health`, `int xPosition`, `int yPosition`.
- Constructor: Initiates player's name, score, health, and starting position.
- Methods: Move the player (`moveUp`, `moveDown`, `moveLeft`, `moveRight`), a method to print player info.

##### Enemy Class

- Attributes: `String type`, `int strength`, `int xPosition`, `int yPosition`.
- Constructor: Initializes the enemy's properties.
- Methods: Set behavior methods for interaction with the player (e.g., `interact(Player player)`).

##### Game Class

- Attributes: `String name`, `Player player`, `List<Enemy> enemies`.
- Constructor: Initializes the game with a player and a series of enemies.
- Main game loop method within which the game runs (`runGame()`).

  <summary>üõ† Example Setup</summary>

  ```java
  public class Player {
      // Fields
      private String name;
      private int score;
      private int health;
      private int xPosition;
      private int yPosition;

      // Constructor
      public Player(String name) {
          this.name = name;
          this.score = 0;
          this.health = 100;
          this.xPosition = 0;
          this.yPosition = 0;
      }
      
      // Provide move, getters, setters, and printInfo methods
  }
  ```

  ```java
  public class Enemy {
      // Fields
      private String type;
      private int strength;
      private int xPosition;
      private int yPosition;

      // Constructor
      public Enemy(String type, int strength, int x, int y) {
          this.type = type;
          this.strength = strength;
          this.xPosition = x;
          this.yPosition = y;
      }
      
      // Define interact method here
  }
  ```

  ```java
  public class Game {
      // Fields
      private String name;
      private Player player;
      private List<Enemy> enemies;

      // Constructor
      public Game(String name, Player player) {
          this.name = name;
          this.player = player;
          this.enemies = new ArrayList<>();
      }

      // Method to run and manage the game
  }
  ```
</details>

#### Exercise 2: Getters, Setters, and Interaction
Add getter and setter methods for encapsulation, enabling safe access to private fields.

- Player: Create `getters` and `setters` for all fields.
- Enemy: Access and modify enemy attributes.
- Game: Manage interactions between players and enemies using methods like `interactWithEnemies()`.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Player Example </summary>

  ```java
  public class Player {
      // Fields
      private String name;
      private int score;
      private int health;
      private int xPosition;
      private int yPosition;

      // Constructor and move methods remain the same

      // Getters and Setters
      public String getName() { return name; }
      public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
      
      public int getScore() { return score; }
      public void setScore(int score) { this.score = score; }

      // Implement other getters/setters
  }
  ```
</details>

#### Exercise 3: Game Actions and Enemy Interaction
Define the player's ability to move and interact with enemies.

- Game: Within `runGame()`, include logic for moving, scoring, and enemy interactions.
- Create utility methods for score updates and position management within your game loop.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Simple Game Logic Example </summary>

  ```java
  public class Game {
      // Fields and constructor remain the same
      
      public void runGame() {
          System.out.println("Welcome to " + this.name + "!");
          // Add pseudo code here for game interaction and loop
          // Check player interaction with enemy and update score
      }
  }
  ```

  This code skeleton lets you implement movements and interactions creatively!
</details>

#### Exercise 4: Practice with Scope and Variable Shadowing
Illustrate examples of variable shadowing and solve issues using `this` keyword:

```java
public class Example {
    private int exampleVar = 100;

    public void demonstrateShadowing() {
        int exampleVar = 50;
        System.out.println(exampleVar); // Prints local variable, intended to use object variable.
    }
}
```

Consider correcting it by focusing on correct variable references within methods and constructors.
